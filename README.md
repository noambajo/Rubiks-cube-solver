# Rubik's cube solver

## Motivation for this project
I have always been fascinated by solving rubik's cubes, the thought of holding one of the ~43 quintillion different permutations and with a certain algorithm ('cubing' jargon for a set of steps to solve a cube) arrive to the most famous permutation. To put that enormous number into perspective, if you had a standard-sizes rubik's cube (5.6 cms / 2.25" each edge) for each possible permutation, you could cover the surface of the earth 275 times, or stack them in a 261 light-year-tall ($`~2.4 \times 10^{15}`$ km) tower.

## Project description
This project is a final thesis for my HS computer science course. As the name suggests, this project solves a rubik's cube.<br> After showing each of the 6 faces of the cube to the camera, an algorithm will be printed to the screen.
